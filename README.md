[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Excape/hsr-docs-fs17.svg?token=ZqvKykpEV75vbEi3DHD8&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Excape/hsr-docs-fs17)

These are my notes for the spring semester 2017. They are all written in markdown and rendered with [MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/releases).

Deployed with travis to http://doc.robinsuter.ch

Notes are my own, code samples are sometimes from lectures. No guarantee of correctness.
